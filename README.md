# A Screen A Day
An exercise in copying things.

## What is in this repo?
This repository contains an iOS Xcode project with various screens and features that I have attempted to copy from popular apps that I use regularly. The main purpose of this project is to experiment with new and novel ways of implementing things, and to 'learn from the greats'. I'm aiming to complete one screen per day, and will also be writing a blog series on the process.

To summarise...
